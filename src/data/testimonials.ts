			"Seth and his team at R. Gonynor and Sons have completed two projects for us, a full color change on the exterior of our home and then wallpaper removal and paint of the interior. Seth was extremely responsive and came out both times and provided us with a free quote which was reasonable and affordable! We could not be happier with the work they did on our home. Seth and his crew are knowledgeable, trustworthy, friendly and professional. I highly recommend R. Gonynor and Sons for their excellent service and top notch quality.",

			"Highly recommend R.Gonynor and Sons for your next project. They just completed repainting the interior of my house, replacing plumbing fixtures, light fixtures, staining the deck and other maintenance items. They were so pleasant to work with from the estimate through the end of the job. Everyone on the crew did excellent work and always cleaned up at the end of the day. Well priced and professional! Thank you Seth and crew. I would not hesitate to use them again.",

			"We just had Seth and his team work on our kitchen cabinets. Matt and Steve were excellent workers who were professional, concise, and courteous. They worked long hours to ensure that our project would be completed in a timely manner. Seth did an excellent job on the doors and they look INCREDIBLE. We are happy with the work that was done and I look forward to using R Gonynor and Sons in the future.",
